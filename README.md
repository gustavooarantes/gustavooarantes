<h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Gustavo, and I'm currently studying to become a back-end developer!</p>
<p>Pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.
Passionate about technology, I have solid experience using languages such as Java and Python, using them to develop APIs that can be easily applied to other services. For performing such tasks, I have used tools like Java Spring (with libraries like Spring Web, Hibernate(JPA/Validation), Lombok, Spring Security, OAuth2 and SPring AMQP), Django and Flask. I have knowledge related to different system architectures (like monolites and microservices), Docker and Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, unit tests and both relation and non-relational databases (SQL and NoSQL), using MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.</p>
