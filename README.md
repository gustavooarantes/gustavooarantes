<h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Gustavo, I'm currently studying to become a data analyst!</p>
<p>Pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.
Passionate about technology, I have solid experience using tools such as Python, SQL and NoSQL, Excel, and Power BI, always striving to stay updated with the latest market trends.
Currently, I work as an intern in Business Intelligence, where I use my skills to transform complex data into strategic insights that support business decision-making. Additionally, my previous experience in a Bachelor's program in Mathematics, during which I conducted research related to the field of Optimization, allows me to understand algorithms and data structures concepts at a higher level of abstraction, enabling me to apply them more efficiently depending on each situation.</p>
