<h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Gustavo, I'm currently studying to become a back-end developer!</p>
<p>My story with programming begins at age 13, back when I used to play lots of games. Just by curiosity, I started to learn how to create servers for one of those games, using Java as the main programming language to do so.
After that, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS, then started to build some REALLY ugly, but functional websites on my own. And so I spend ages 13 to 15 building my own little projects using the little that I knew, just for the
fun of doing so. Unfortunately I had to quit programming when I started High School, because I needed to focus on studying for my exams. After finishing High School, I spent one year and a half at Law School (which I didn't like
very much), then decided to change to Math, where at the second semester I had contact with the C language for a specific class. I fell in love again with technologies and development, so, after a lot of thinking, I decided to definetly
move my focus to study just that: the art of programming and everything that envolves it.</p>
<p>I have finished succesfully Harvard's CS50x and CS50p, where I had contact with C, Python, JavaScript among other things. Currently, I'm dedicating my time to study - on my own - Java and Python, while building projects that aim to
solve real life problems (or any crazy ideas that I have really), and am also studying Data Structures and Algorithms to perfect my skills.</p>
